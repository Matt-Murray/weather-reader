# Weather Reader

This is a web app that presents your local weather conditions using your geolocation 
through FreeCodeCamp's weather API. It was written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with
JSON and JQuery.

## Reflection

This project was built as part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum. It enabled
me to hone my skills in JSON, JQuery, and DOM manipulation.
